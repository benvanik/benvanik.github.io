I've been thinking a bit recently about what I'd do if I were to build a new
ZUI framework for the web. What kind of things would I build with it? Where
would it run? What kind of content would it support? How specific/general
would it be? And most importantly, how would it be a million times better than
what I've written before as to be even the remotest bit interesting?

Current thoughts: social media aggregation service/photo gallery,
WebKit/FF/iOS, photos/videos/simple DOM fragments, fully open source, free,
and documented here for everyone to steal
