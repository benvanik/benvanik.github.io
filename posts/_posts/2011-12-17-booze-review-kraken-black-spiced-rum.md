I bought this awhile back for the bottle and didn't bother actually opening it
until just last week. It turns out that the contents have the flavor and
mouthfeel to match the awesome design work and I now feel a bit silly for
letting it sit on my shelf for a year...

I've tried it both in coffee and bubbly mixers and found it to be a great
complement to the sweet/carmel-ly Vivace dolce blend and Mexican Coke, ginger
ale, and ginger beer. Even neat it's delicious - a very light texture for such
a rich and strong (94 proof) rum, and a very mild spicy finish.
