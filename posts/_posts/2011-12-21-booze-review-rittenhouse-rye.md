**Oh**. **My**. **God**. This stuff is good. Cheap as hell and absolutely delicious. Tastes almost more like a bourbon than a rye, with the punch of a rye but strong caramel and sweet/cherry flavors. I hear it's rare as it's [bottled-in-bond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_in_bond) and on an upward swing of popularity - meaning that there isn't a big back log of aging barrels.... so I'm going back to the liquor store now to buy all of the rest... HA HA SUCKERS ![](http://fusedsource.com/forums/public/style_emoticons/default/TrollFace%5B1%5D.png)
