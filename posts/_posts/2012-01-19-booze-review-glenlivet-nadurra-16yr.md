I'm a fan of most of Glenlivet's line, but this is something entirely
different. Nose of anise, flavor of vanilla and pepper, long lingering finish.
It's cask strength yet sippable even without having to water it down, for as
intense a flavor as this scotch has it remains silky smooth.

By far my favorite Glenlivet.
