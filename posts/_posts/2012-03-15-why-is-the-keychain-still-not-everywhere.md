title: Why is the Keychain still not everywhere?

One of my favorite features of OSX is the Keychain - it Just Works&trade; - it's
so valuable to me that for awhile I was paying for MobileMe just so that it
could sync my keychain between all of my machines.

Why then, in this age of increasingly strong password requirements (and the
inevitable forgetting of said passwords) with an increasing number of useful
services that require them, has Apple not brought this magic to their entire
platform?

Imagine for a second if your Apple ID (plus some 2-factor auth, which they
really need) became your master login: you never have to remember a password
again and the friction to use a service on any (Apple) device suddenly goes to
zero. Login to Netflix on your PC, instantly gain access on your iPhone, and
later when in bed pull it up on your iPad. Acquire a new device? One password
and the device is active and ready to use. Forget your password for the
obscure media service you rarely use? Who cares! You don't need to enter it!

I've long wanted this and have been surprised that even though the
infrastructure exists at Apple they haven't given this problem any attention.
What brought it to the forefront for me was my new Apple TV that I just setup.
In my dreamy impossible dream land this is what my out-of-box experience would
have been like:

1. Plug in
2. Enter wifi info
3. Enter Apple ID
4. Play! Smile! Enjoy my new toy!

Instead, here's how it went down:

1. Plug in
2. Select 'English'
3. Enter wifi info
4. Home->Settings->iTunes
5. Enter Apple ID + password
6. Home->Settings->Home Sharing
7. Enter Apple ID + password, again
8. Home->YouTube->Log in
9. (because I'm using 2-factor auth with Google): grab a new application specific password from the web
10. Enter Google account + ASP
11. Fail, because I entered one of the 16 characters in the password wrong on the little remote/OSK
12. Re-enter email because it didn't remember it, and password (correctly, this time)
13. Home->Netflix->Log in
14. Enter Netflix info
15. Fail, because I forgot my password, go to the website and perform password recovery
16. Wait for mail.... make some coffee....
17. Enter Netflix info
18. Home->Photo Stream->Log in
19. Enter Apple ID + password - wtf really?
20. Apple authentication servers down, unable to login
21. FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
22. Write a blog post about how shitty the experience was

Massive missed opportunity to delight the user, here. And it's not just out-
of-box where this matters but day-to-day too - I may get an app on my iPhone
that then auto-downloads to my iPad, but by the time I go to run it on my iPad
the next day I've already forgotten whatever stupid password I chose to fit
the arbitrary security requirements. When this happens I'll often just delete
the app, or 'come back to it later' (and never do so). Completely unnecessary
- it should just work!



Oh, and mini review on the 2012 Apple TV: picture quality is great (as
expected) and the new UI is a bit better (less hierarchy that wasn't needed).
All-in-all worth it because I'll never have to turn on my PS3 to watch 1080p
Netflix streams. Haven't tried AirPlay yet, but I'm betting it looks much
better in 1080p (if it actually runs at that).
