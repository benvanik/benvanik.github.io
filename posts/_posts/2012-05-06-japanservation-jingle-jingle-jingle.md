The Japanese economy is almost entirely cash-based, and until coming here I
had almost forgot how much I hated change.

I believe there are a few factors contributing to the number of jingling coins
in my pocket:

1. Very few places accept any form of non-cash payment
(credit/debit/phone/etc). Generally only high end restaurants and hotels take
Visa. Even meals over $100 still sometimes only take cash. Don't even bother
bringing a credit card (but do bring a debit card for getting cash from ATMs).

2. There's no tipping in Japan. Prices are adjusted with 'service charges'
that take care of it, but it means that the normal 'keep the change' behavior
that prevents the accumulation of coins in the US doesn't work here. Often
times prices in the US are designed to leave you with very small amounts of
extra change that can be thoughtlessly handed over for tip, but in Japan it's
not uncommon to end up with a charge of 110Y that results in 90Y of stupid,
jingly coins.

3. Vending machines are ubiquitous, and their price increments often require
the use and disbursement of 10Y coins (about 10c).

Somehow, despite all of this, no Japanese person - man or woman - ever sounds
as if they are carrying change. It's assured that they are, as it's impossible
to spend more than an hour out of the house and not end up with some.
Meanwhile, giant gaijin is rattling like a toddler with a toy down the streets
of Tokyo. Sigh.

Current working theory: the Japanese have developed and kept secret negative-
space matter-compression wallets with infinite coin carrying capacity and no
noise leakage.
