I've been on a home organization kick lately and one area I've found severely
underserved is a decent inventory/suggestion app for spirits.

I feel like what I want is fairly minimal:

* A list of the spirits I've tried (and what I thought about them)
* A list of the bottles I own
* What my friends have and their ratings
* Suggestions of what to buy/try next

(note that you can replace booze with books, videogames, tv shows, etc and I'd
use that too)

I'd say I want something like goodreads but for booze, however goodreads only
hits half of the magic here. I think there's the potential for something
better: imagine if you had a Netflix-like suggestion system but for what to
drink.

I'm thinking of a simple inventory tracker with some nice features but with a
dynamic 'drinkers profile' that would be constructed based on your ratings.
From there you could find similar drinkers and see their suggestions, ask
friends who have similar tastes for recommendations, and get an automated
'bottle replacement' function.

The problem I have is this: there's a lot of booze out there I haven't tried
and when I run a bottle dry at home the QFC employee isn't the person who I
want telling me what to get next. I think it'd be fun to mark a bottle as
drank in the app and have it suggest another bottle for me - not just at
random but based on price-range (monthly spending amount), current liquor
cabinet mix, what's trending, recommendations, etc. The perfect next bottle.

Future versions could add fun features on top of this - once you have a
drinkers profile it could suggest cocktails and extras like bitters/mixers in
a much better way than most sites. With an accurate inventory it can also tell
you what you should be drinking based on what you've got at home and what mood
you're in (like the TED 'inspire me' feature). Of course, data nerds could
track things like cocktail cost/calories/etc.

A simple, free, mobile-friendly web app that had this magic would be killer, I
feel.
