I recently came across [Garvrilov
translation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavrilov_translation) (aka single-
voice translation), a technique whereby movies or TV shows are dubbed over by
a single voice actor. That means every man, woman, child, dog, etc has the
same voice - usually some random dude with little talent. Factor in cheap
translation of the source material, throw in some lo-fi recording/dubbing, and
you end up with some pretty hilarious stuff.

So yeah. I think this would be the funniest thing in the world. I would watch
everything like this. Seriously. Imagine Jersey Shore, Game of Thrones, or Fox
News where every voice was done some untalented middle-aged guy reading off a
poorly-translated dialog sheet. Gold.

Most content is produced in English and then run through voice-over
translation for other markets that can't afford full dubbing. Being (sadly)
unilingual this means that I can't quite enjoy it as much as I want... Damn.
BUT: science!

So here's the idea: upload a video to YouTube for [automatic
captions](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/automatic-captions-in-
youtube.html), extract the captions, machine-translate to some not-too-
difficult language and back (just to get some awkwardness), run text-to-speech
to produce an audio track, mix in RiffTrax-style.

Probably a 30 line python script. Now, where'd I put my motivation...
